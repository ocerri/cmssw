/**
 To finish the implementation, this is what we need to do: We would like to make the dimension of the missing particle depend on
 the mass constraint. That means that any call to 'setMassConstraint' should invalidate the 'indices'. The creation of indices is
 done with 'DecayChain::updateIndex'. We could call this from 'initPar' (or from any other place that initialized the
 constraints. That also means that 'setMassConstraint' should change Fitter.m_fitStatus to Unfitted'. Finally, to make sure that
 we don't break anything, we need a test case.
